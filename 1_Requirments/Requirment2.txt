 Book Information Recording: All the information of each books should be recorded
into the system to provide the borrowers or the students the book references that they
want to borrow.
 Administrator Login: The admin login will require the school librarian their email and
password to have the main access to the system and secure every information ang
transaction done in the system.
 Users/Borrowers' Login: This will also require the users or students email and password
provided when they were registered into the system. Their email and password will serve
as their access to the system in terms of borrowing books or inquiring for books.
 Book Monitoring and Updates: The system should save the borrowers info and the
count of books that are borrowed. These records should also be updatable when the books
are returned.
 View and Check Information: The admin can view and check the books that are
borrowed and who were the students that borrowed them. Students can also view their
borrowing transactions just like the book information, date of book borrowing and
returning.
 Borrowing Information: The borrowing information should consist the important details
of the borrowers and the books borrowed by each borrowers. This information should
also record the day of borrowing as well as the returning of the book.
 Borrowing Records: This will record all the transaction made and are stored for a period
of time to serve as reference for important matters.
These modules must be present in creating the Library Management system Project to satisfy the
needs in managing Library transactions. Through this, the borrowing and returning of books
would be much easier for both students and librarians.
